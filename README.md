# Build and run
- Open these websites using your Web browser along with the solution stack that you're using (WAMP, LAMP, MAMP, XAMPP). Copy the source code files to the htdocs folder.
# Updates
+ 2021-08-18: All of the websites in this repository have been updated to Bootstrap 5.1.0.
# Notes
- These websites are programmed with Visual Studio Code.
- By default, MAMP requires the root password in order to access to the MySQL database. If you use a solution stack that does not require a password in order to access to the base, you can remove it on the $pw variable of the 'db.php' file.

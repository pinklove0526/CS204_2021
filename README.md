# CS204 - Advanced Web Programming
A list of websites (including source codes) using Bootstrap 5, Ionicons 5, PHP, CSS, JavaScript and MySQL database.
# Included in this repository
+ Week 10: Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
+ Lab 10: ITEC To-do app
+ Midterm test (actual name: Solar System)
# Build and run
- Open these websites using your Web browser along with the solution stack that you're using (WAMP, LAMP, MAMP, XAMPP). Copy the source code files to the htdocs folder.
# Notes
- These websites are programmed with Visual Studio Code.
- By default, MAMP requires the root password in order to access to the MySQL database. If you use a solution stack that does not require a password in order to access to the base, you can remove it on the $pw variable of the 'db.php' file.
